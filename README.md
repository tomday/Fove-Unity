# Fove-Unity Documentation

This is repository contains files that outline the variables and methods exposed by the Fove-Unity plugin for the [Fove](https://getfove.com) HMD

At the moment, the two available classes are

1. [Fove](Fove.md)
2. [FoveInterface](FoveInterface.md)

I am not affiliated with FOVE, Inc. and neither is this repository. I am personally updating the documentation as I use the API.
